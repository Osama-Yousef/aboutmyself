# aboutmyself

**We have used for loop**
**Where we guess my favorite number and there were four attempts for the user to try and guess the number**
**When the number entered by the user is close to the preferred number, we give the user a notice that the number is close to the one entered, or a notice that the number entered is far from the preferred number**

**And then we added a question about the preferred color and there was an array of options and there are 6 attempts to guess the color and when the user chooses a color from the array gives a correct answer and if the answer is wrong there are only 6 attempts to guess the color and then gives a notice of all the colors in the array**

**Then we add a code so that the user can be calculated for his result and how many correct answers have been answered**
